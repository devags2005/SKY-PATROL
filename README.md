# SKY_PATROL 

SKY_PATROL is a beginner-friendly project that simulates the use of AI and image processing to detect unauthorized construction from aerial imagery. Itâ€™s a proof-of-concept idea for monitoring city planning violations using satellite/drone images.

## Goals

- Detect suspicious construction activities from aerial views.
- Help city planners monitor land usage in real-time.
- Show how AI can be used for urban development and planning.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **Scikit-learn** (for classification)
- **OpenCV / PIL** (for image handling)
- **Matplotlib** (for image visualization)
- **Jupyter Notebook or Streamlit** (optional for interface)
